# Colorblind Helper - GrimCo Edition
Provides a way to add overlays to any item in the game, to assist with colorblindness in Minecraft.

This fork is based off othe work of tterrag in Colorblind Helper and has been changed to remove the dependency on EnderCore.

As such, this mod contains a core mod if that sort of thing scares you.
